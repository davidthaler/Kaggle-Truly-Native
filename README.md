## Kaggle "Truly Native?" competition code

The ["Truly Native?"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dato-native) 
competition was hosted on Kaggle and sponsored by Dato/Graphlab
Create with data provided by StumbleUpon. 
The competition involved predicting which of 
a large set of web pages were sponsored advertising, based on their contents. 
There were about 400,000 webpages total, provided as raw HTML.
The model implemented here finished 18th out of 274.

### Requirements
To run this model, you will need:
*  The [data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dato-native/data). Do not unzip the files.
You may have to agree to a set of competition rules before downloading.
*  Python - version 2.7.10 
*  numpy - 1.9.2
*  scipy - 0.15.1
*  Pandas - 0.16.2 
*  scikit-learn - 0.16.1
*  BeautifulSoup - 4.3.2   
*  Pypy - 2.4.0
The model does not use any cutting edge features of those packages, 
so any recent versions should be fine.
